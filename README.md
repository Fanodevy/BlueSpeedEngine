# BlueSpeedEngine
A modified version of the Sonic Infinity Engine


---

## Project Overview

### What is BlueSpeedEngine?

BlueSpeedEngine is a modified version of the Sonic Infinity Engine.  
It provides a lighter and more accessible framework for creating Sonic-style games in Unreal Engine.

### What is the goal of this project?

The main goal is to offer a simplified alternative to existing Sonic frameworks on Unreal Engine.

While the core logic of the original Sonic Infinity Engine is preserved to keep its structure intact, unused or unnecessary systems have been removed to make the project cleaner and easier to work with.

This repository also serves as an accessible alternative, especially since the original Sonic Infinity Engine project was removed from GitHub.

### Who is this for?

BlueSpeedEngine is intended for:
 
- Creators who want to build a Sonic game in the simplest way possible  
- Users looking for a beginner-friendly base to modify and expand  

### How is it different from the original Sonic Infinity Engine?

The biggest difference is that many unused systems have been removed.

The overall structure and logic remain close to the original engine, but the framework is lighter and easier to understand.

## Roadmap & Project Status

This project is open and available to everyone as an alternative Sonic framework.

Currently, further development is not a priority, and no major updates are planned.

However, you are free to modify, expand, and adapt the engine to fit your own project.

If you are looking for more advanced or feature-rich Sonic frameworks, you may want to explore other alternatives.

BlueSpeedEngine is made for you if you want:

- A more beginner-friendly base  
- A framework that is easier to understand and modify  
- A simple foundation for building a Sonic game
